					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hey, my name is Sam Atilano! I'm a third year art major. I love reading, writing, listening to music, and watching Youtube/tv shows/movies during my freetime. I'm mostly interested in the animation industry, specifically the drafting of concept art for 2-D and 3-D animation, but I'd love to be a part of the process of a stop motion film in the future as well.</p>
